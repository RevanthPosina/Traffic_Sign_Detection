Built a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. This model is able to read and understand traffic signs , an application for self driving car.

GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark -- data set is used from Kaggle

ðŸ’» Keras, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas, PIL and image classification are used in the project

ðŸ’» CNN is used for image classification
trained model is compiled with the model with Adam optimizer

ðŸ‘½ a graphical user interface for our traffic signs classifier with Tkinter.

ðŸ’¥ traffic_classifier.h5 -- is the loaded trained model
